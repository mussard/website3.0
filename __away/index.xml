      <description>My research consists in developments in electronic structure of molecular and solid systems. There are two fundamental aspects to my work. On the one hand, my approach is analytic and theoretical and consists in developing new methods and approximations. On the other hand, an integral part of my work is technical and is about implementing these developments in widely used quantum chemistry packages.  My work has branched into three main parts: I have been focused in the description of London dispersion forces in Density Functional Theory (DFT) in the context of range-separated theories coupled with the Random Phase Approximation (RPA).</description>
